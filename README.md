# django-online-job-portal

Developed an online job portal system using the Django framework that supports multiple user roles, including administrators, recruiters, and job seekers. The application provides user registration and authentication, job search functionality with basic filtering, and profile management features allowing users and recruiters to create, update, and manage their information.

This project was built to gain hands-on experience with Django fundamentals, authentication workflows, role-based access control, and database-driven web applications.

**Tech stack:** Django, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
